# Advanced Systems Lab 2018

This is my submission for the advanced systems lab at ETH Zurich in fall 2018. This lab required to individually develop a
middleware which acts as a load balancer between clients and NoSQL key-value store servers.
After deploying the middleware in the cloud, I developed and ran thorough test scripts that ran for over twelve hours
autonomously to gather data which I now use to identify and analyze the bottlenecks of this system.

The course description can be found here:

The report with a detailed explanation of the setup and the tests can be found in the submodule 'asl_report': https://github.com/phil9987/asl_report
